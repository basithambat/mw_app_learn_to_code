TO SEE THE SUCCESS MESSAGE AND PROGRESS:

The build script is running. To see the output:

1. The script shows progress in the terminal where it's running
2. Look for messages like:
   - "STEP 1/7: Checking device..."
   - "STEP 4/7: Building APK..."
   - "✅ Build successful!"
   - "✅ Installation successful!"
   - "✅✅✅ SUCCESS!"

3. The final success message will say:
   "✅✅✅ SUCCESS!"
   "The WhatSay app should now be on your phone!"

4. Check your phone - the app icon should appear!

If you want to see the output, the script is running in the background.
The success message appears when:
- Build completes
- APK is installed
- App is verified on device
