BUILD STATUS SUMMARY
====================

I've executed the following commands:

1. ✅ Checked if app is installed: adb shell pm list packages | grep whatsay
2. ✅ Checked device connection: adb devices  
3. ✅ Started build process: npx expo run:android --device

CURRENT STATUS:
==============

The build command has been executed. Here's what you should see:

IN YOUR TERMINAL:
- Gradle build output
- Compilation progress
- "Installing APK" messages
- "Launching app" confirmation

ON YOUR PHONE:
- Installation progress notification
- WhatSay app icon appearing
- App launching automatically

EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- 0-5 min: Gradle compiling
- 5-8 min: Building APK
- 8-10 min: Installing on device
- 10+ min: App launches

TO VERIFY:
Run in your terminal:
  adb shell pm list packages | grep whatsay

If you see: com.safwanambat.whatsay
Then: ✅ App is installed!

NEXT STEPS:
1. Watch your terminal for build progress
2. Check your phone for the app
3. If errors appear, share them with me

The build is running. Check your phone in 5-10 minutes!
